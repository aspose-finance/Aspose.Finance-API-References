## Tuple class

A tuple is an element in the substitution group for the XBRL tuple element. Tuples are used to bind together the parts of a compound fact. Those constituent parts are themselves, facts but they must be interpreted in light of each-other. For example, the name, age and compensation of a director of a company need to be grouped together to be correctly understood.

```csharp
public class Tuple : Fact
```
