## Label class

This class is a [`Xlink`](../xlink) with Resource type. Although each taxonomy defines a single set of elements representing a set of business reporting Concepts, the human-readable XBRL documentation for those concepts, including labels (strings used as human-readable names for each concept) and other explanatory documentation, is contained in a resource element in the label Linkbase.

```csharp
public class Label : Resource
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
