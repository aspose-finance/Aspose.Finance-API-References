## Concept class

Concepts are defined in two equivalent ways. 
In a syntactic sense, a concept is an XML Schema element definition, 
defining the element to be in the item element substitution group or in the tuple element substitution group. 
At a semantic level, a concept is a definition of a kind of fact that can be reported about the activities or nature of a business activity.



The Concept type exposes the following members:
