## Tuple class

A tuple is an element in the substitution group for the XBRL tuple element.
Tuples are used to bind together the parts of a compound fact. 
Those constituent parts are themselves, facts but they must be interpreted in light of each-other. 
For example, the name, age and compensation of a director of a company need to be grouped together to be correctly understood.



**Inheritance:** [Tuple](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl/tuple) → 
[Fact](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl/fact)



The Tuple type exposes the following members:
