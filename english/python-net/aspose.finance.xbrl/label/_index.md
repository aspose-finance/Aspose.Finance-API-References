## Label class

This class is a [Xlink](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl/xlink) with Resource type.
Although each taxonomy defines a single set of elements representing a set of business reporting Concepts, 
the human-readable XBRL documentation for those concepts, including labels (strings used as human-readable names for each concept) and other explanatory documentation, is contained in a resource element in the label Linkbase.



**Inheritance:** [Label](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl/label) →
