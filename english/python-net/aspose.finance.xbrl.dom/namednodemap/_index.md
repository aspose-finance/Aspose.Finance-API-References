## NamedNodeMap class

Represents collections of attributes that can be accessed by name.



The NamedNodeMap type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [length](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl.dom/namednodemap/length) | Gets the number of attributes in the map. |



Gets the attribute at the specified index. If index is greater than or equal to the number of attributes in this map, this returns null.
### Indexer
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [index] | The zero based index of the attribute. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [get_named_item(name)](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl.dom/namednodemap/get_named_item/#str) | Gets the attribute specified by name. |
| [get_named_item_ns(namespace_uri, local_name)](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl.dom/namednodemap/get_named_item_ns/#str-str) | Gets the attribute specified by local name and namespace URI. |
| [set_named_item(item)](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl.dom/namednodemap/set_named_item/#Attr) | Adds a node using its nodeName attribute. If a node with that name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect. |
| [set_named_item_ns(item)](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl.dom/namednodemap/set_named_item_ns/#Attr) | Adds a node using its namespaceURI and localName. If a node with that namespace URI and that local name is already present in this map, it is replaced by the new one. Replacing a node by itself has no effect. |
| [remove_named_item(name)](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl.dom/namednodemap/remove_named_item/#str) | Removes a attribute specified by name. |
| [remove_named_item_ns(namespace_uri, local_name)](/finance/python-net/aspose.finance.xbrl.dom/namednodemap/remove_named_item_ns/#str-str) | Removes a attribute specified by local name and namespace URI. |
